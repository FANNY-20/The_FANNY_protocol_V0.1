# The_FANNY_protocol_V0.1
a Fully ANoNYmous and decentralized pandemic witness protocol (FANNY)

In this pandemic context many approach try to propose the best compromise between anonymity and privacy, reliability, accessibility and efficiency. We think that this kind of situation could unfortunately be more frequent in the future regarding the epidemic that we observed the last two decades.

The technology could help to minimize the impact and to facilitate living in this kind sustainable context.

We thought about a solution of course should be improved but it's probably an interesting alternative.

This alternative is on an X11 license and each contribution is welcome. The source codebase is coming.

It's main originality is the using of a Web RTC API to establish the peer to peer communication.We tried to maximize the distribution of the tasks in order to decentralize the approach. The last issue that we try to solve the anonymity with creating Dada's very poor on information's.

You can read the pdf document that explain what we propose.
