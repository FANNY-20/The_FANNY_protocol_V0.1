# The FANNY Protocol 0.1

Fully ANoNYmous and decentralized pandemic witness protocol (FANNY)

# Context

In this pandemic context, many approaches try to propose the best compromise between anonymity and privacy, reliability, accessibility and efficiency. We think that this kind of situation could unfortunately repeat itself in the future regarding the epidemics that were observed the last two decades.

The technology could help to minimize the propagation and impact of diseases and to facilitate living in this kind of context.

# What we propose :

Our protocol allows to alert who was in a narrow contact with a positive covid-19 patient up to 15 days after the first contact occurred. This protocol focuses on a maximum of decentralization, processing distribution and information division with an absolute focus on:

1. Anonymity 
2. Privacy
3. Accessibility
4. Reliability
5. Scalability
6. Availability
7. Transparency

We have figured out a solution that of course should be improved but it seems like an
interesting alternative.

--&gt; This alternative is on an X11 license and each contribution is welcome. The
source codebase is coming.

- The main originality is the usage of a Web RTC API to establish the peer to peer communication.
- We tried to maximize the distribution of the tasks and data storage in order to decentralize the approach. 
- The last challenge we tried to solve focuses on the anonymity while creating very light &amp; poor data, divided, distributed and decentralized. The data must be recombined to extract a usable information.

# In this repository, you will find:

- An article that explain the basic version of our protocol.
- An MIT X11 licence.
- And coming soon the code-base of our prototype.
